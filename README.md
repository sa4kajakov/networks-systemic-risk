This project analyzes systemic risk in interbank financial networks. It combines statistical and network analysis of bank balance sheets with contagion simulations using the Furfine algorithm to model default cascades. 
The study also extends to portfolio losses, showing how overlapping exposures to common assets amplify systemic fragility and tipping-point dynamics in financial crises.
